# WEB103 Prework - _CREATORVERSE_

Submitted by: **Enmanuelle Martinez**

About this web app: **Creatorverse is a small CRUD web app for showcasing internet creators. Built with React (Vite) and React Router, it stores creator data in Supabase. The homepage shows creators as responsive cards; each card links to a dedicated detail page with a large image, description, and social links. Users can add, edit, and delete creators, with a custom confirmation modal on delete. Styling is a simple dark theme with a banner hero and card/grid/form styles.**
